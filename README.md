# Convolutional Code Using Viterbi Algorithm

This project demonstrates the implementation of convolutional encoding and decoding using the Viterbi algorithm. The MATLAB `.mlx` file contains the complete code, including general functions for both encoding and decoding. The decoding process supports both hard decision decoding and soft decision decoding methods.

## Project Highlights
